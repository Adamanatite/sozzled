Things for Sam to do:
    -Improve cards and hints
    -List of cards
    -Card front designs / rules cards
    -Packaging for box


Website fixes:
    -Better SVG icons/sizes for player boxes (in edit player at least)
    -Fix magic numbers (in player input box, total main page white box size)
    -Fix repeated variables (max player name length etc.)
    -Move repeated code into functions (e.g. edited player and full player slot HTML changing)




Next Steps:

    -Make rules animation perfectly loop
    -Tweak exact values to make the circles look nice (ideally increase distance between far ones and decrease between central ones)

    -Fix homepage player slots (icons)

    -Homepage infinite animations

    Design:
        -Improve card choice and active pages
        -Finalise logo (SVG version)

    -CSS/JS Refactoring (more utility classes for repeated function and avoid hard-coding values for font-size etc.)
        -Change orderings to make sense
        -Remove all hard-coded "magic" values (add variables for specific elements that can be changed at different resolutions maybe?)
        -Have proper content container and background div across all pages (maybe use body for background colour?)
        -Fix data attribute to work with everything (no specific hard-coding)
        -Restructure JavaScript methods
        -Add more JavaScript comments where necessary
        -Use inset when applicable (main content box, card content)
        -Learn/test with screenreader

    -Main page
        -Work out main content centering
        -Implement main content designs in CSS
        -Page transition animations
        -Background animations
        -Settings page JS (internal logic and animations on buttons/toggles, look at how its done by google etc)
        -Main page input cleanup for names
            -Strip leading and ending whitespace from player names and case-match
            -Disallow duplicate names
        -Test with screenreader

    -Card select page
        -Maybe horizontal version of mobile when thinner than 3 card lengths (maybe only need to switch flex direction if top/bottom are absolute)
